This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This repo will implement some list sample using react to a code challenge.

The goals are:

* Create a List and Detail view for some model (e.g: todos, posts, products)
* it should use React
* it should use inline style
* it should be open sourced on your github repo

Some extras can be implement:

* Also Implement in React Native
* it should use ReactNavigation
* Implement code splitting using react-loadable
* Optimize webpack
* Create a storybook with your components
* Test your components with jest
